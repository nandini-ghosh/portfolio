        <p>Brewing tea is the most relaxing step when it comes to making your perfect cup of tea. Make sure you
        have taken a peek at our page about <a href="p1.html">the different varieties of tea</a>, to pick your tea-type today. Tea
        leaves come in many forms, the most common being tea-bags and loose leaf tea. If you are using loose leaf tea,
        make sure to keep a strainer handy.
        
        Here's a list of equipment you require, which are easy to find around the home:
        <li>• <b>Tea Leaves | </b> either tea-bags or loose leaf</li>
        <li>• <b>Electric Kettle or Teapot | </b> to boil your water in</li>
        <li>• <b>Filter or Strainer | </b> a must-have for loose leaf tea, skip for tea-bags</li>
        <li>• <b>Cup or Mug | </b> your favourite cup or mug</li>
        <li>• <b>Spoon | </b> to stir the tea with</li></p>
